# Open Source Silicone 3D Printer
Documentation and custom firmware for the silicone printer created for [mLab](https://www.mlabrobotics.com) Check the [wiki](https://github.com/thrushd/Silicone-3D-Printer/wiki) and the PDF Manual for a getting started guide. Created by Dylan Thrush and Steph Walker (Oregon State University). This GitHub includes the CAD files to make the 3D printer parts and also an operating manual.
